Counters are one of the most fundamental UI patterns in web development. Whether you're building a shopping cart, a like button, or a pagination component, you'll often need to manage numeric state that can be incremented, decremented, or reset. Today, we'll explore the [useCounter](/docs/use-counter) hook - a simple yet powerful solution for all your counting needs.

## What is useCounter?

The [useCounter](/docs/use-counter) hook is a custom React hook that provides a clean, efficient way to manage counter state. It encapsulates all the common counter operations you need:

- **Increment**: Add 1 to the current value
- **Decrement**: Subtract 1 from the current value
- **Reset**: Return to the initial value
- **Set**: Jump to any specific value

## The Implementation

Let's look at how this hook is implemented:

```typescript
"use client";

import { useState, useCallback } from "react";

interface UseCounterReturn {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
  decrement: () => void;
  reset: () => void;
  set: (value: number) => void;
}

export function useCounter(initialValue: number = 0): UseCounterReturn {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = useCallback(() => setCount((x) => x + 1), []);
  const decrement = useCallback(() => setCount((x) => x - 1), []);
  const reset = useCallback(() => setCount(initialValue), [initialValue]);
  const set = useCallback((value: number) => setCount(value), []);

  return {
    count,
    increment,
    decrement,
    reset,
    set,
  };
}
```

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Performance Optimized

All mutation methods are wrapped with useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This means your components will only re-render when the count value actually changes, not when the functions are recreated.

### ðŸ”„ Functional State Updates

The hook uses functional state updates ( setCount(x => x + 1) ) which makes it safe to use in React's concurrent mode and prevents stale closure issues.

### ðŸ’¾ Initial Value Memory

The reset function remembers the initial value passed to the hook, so you can always return to your starting point regardless of how the counter has been modified.

## Basic Usage

Here's how you can use the useCounter hook in your components:

```tsx
import { useCounter } from "@/hooks/useCounter";

function CounterExample() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Starting with a Custom Initial Value

### Starting with a Custom Initial Value

The useCounter hook accepts any number as its initial value, making it flexible for different use cases. Here's an example of a score counter that starts at 10 and includes custom increment amounts:

```tsx
function ScoreCounter() {
  const { count, increment, set } = useCounter(10);

  const handleSetToHundred = () => set(100);
  const handleBonus = () => set(count + 50);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Score:{count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>+1Â Point</button>
      <button onClick={handleBonus}>+50Â Bonus</button>
      <button onClick={handleSetToHundred}>SetÂ toÂ 100</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Building a Shopping Cart Counter

### Building a Shopping Cart Counter

A common use case for useCounter is managing product quantities in a shopping cart. Here's an example implementation that includes input validation and minimum quantity constraints:

```tsx
function CartItem({ productId, initialQuantity = 1 }) {
  const { count, increment, decrement, set } = useCounter(initialQuantity);
  const handleQuantityChange = (e) => {
    const newQuantity = parseInt(e.target.value) || 0;
    set(Math.max(0, newQuantity)); //Â EnsureÂ non-negative
  };

  return (
    <div className="cart-item">
      <button onClick={decrement} disabled={count <= 0}>
        -
      </button>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={count}
        onChange={handleQuantityChange}
        min="0"
      />
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Real-World Applications

The useCounter hook shines in many scenarios:

1. E-commerce : Product quantity selectors, cart item counts
2. Social Media : Like counters, comment counts, follower numbers
3. Gaming : Score tracking, lives remaining, level progression
4. Forms : Step counters in multi-step forms
5. Analytics : View counters, download counts

## Why Choose useCounter?

### âœ… Simplicity

No need to write repetitive counter logic in every component.

### âœ… Consistency

Standardized counter behavior across your entire application.

### âœ… Performance

Optimized with useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### âœ… Flexibility

Supports any initial value and provides both relative (increment/decrement) and absolute (set) operations.

### âœ… Type Safety

Fully typed with TypeScript for better developer experience.

## Best Practices

1. Use meaningful initial values : Start your counter with a value that makes sense for your use case.
2. Combine with validation : When using the set function, consider adding validation to ensure the value meets your requirements.
3. Handle edge cases : Consider what should happen when the counter reaches certain limits (negative numbers, maximum values, etc.).
4. Persist when needed : For counters that should survive page refreshes, combine with localStorage or other persistence mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The useCounter hook demonstrates how a simple, well-designed custom hook can eliminate boilerplate code while providing a robust, reusable solution. By encapsulating counter logic with performance optimizations and a clean API, it becomes a valuable tool in any React developer's toolkit.

Whether you're building a simple like button or a complex shopping cart, useCounter provides the foundation you need to manage numeric state effectively. Its simplicity doesn't compromise on power - you get all the counter operations you need with optimal performance out of the box.

Try incorporating useCounter into your next React project and experience the difference that well-crafted custom hooks can make!
