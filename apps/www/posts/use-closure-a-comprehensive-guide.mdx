## Introduction

The [useClosure](/docs/use-closure) hook is a versatile React utility that provides a collection of tools for creating and working with JavaScript closures. This hook demonstrates various closure patterns and offers practical utilities for managing private state, implementing memoization, and achieving encapsulation in your React applications.

## What is a JavaScript Closure?

Before diving into the hook, let's understand what a JavaScript closure is. A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has returned. This powerful concept enables data privacy, state persistence, and the creation of specialized functions with their own isolated environments.

## Installation

The [useClosure](/docs/use-closure) hook is part of the usehooks.io collection. You can use it in your project by installing the package:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli/latest add use-closure
```

## Basic Usage

Here's how to import and use the [useClosure](/docs/use-closure) hook in your React components:
Let's look at a basic example of using the useClosure hook:

```tsx
import { useClosure } from "@hooks/use-closure";

function MyComponent() {
  const { createPrivateState } = useClosure();

  // Create a private counter
  const privateCounter = createPrivateState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    privateCounter.set((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {privateCounter.get()}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

The [useClosure](/docs/use-closure) hook doesn't accept any parameters but returns an object with several utility functions:

### Return Value

The hook returns an object with the following utility functions:

1. **createPrivateState**: Creates a closure with private state that can only be accessed through provided methods.
2. **createCounter**: Creates a classic counter closure with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.
3. **createMemoizer**: Creates a memoization closure that caches function results.
4. **createModule**: Creates a module pattern closure with private state and public methods.
5. **createEventEmitter**: Creates an event emitter using closures for private listener management.
6. **createSecureState**: Creates a secure state closure with validation and controlled access.
7. **demonstrateScope**: Demonstrates how closures capture and maintain access to outer scope variables.

## Utility Functions

### 1. createPrivateState

Creates a closure with private state that can only be accessed through getter and setter methods. This pattern is useful for:

- Encapsulating data that should not be directly accessible
- Controlling how state can be read and modified
- Maintaining data privacy within components
- Providing a clean API for state management

Example usage:

```tsx
const { createPrivateState } = useClosure();

const privateCounter = createPrivateState(0);

// Only way to access the value
console.log(privateCounter.get()); // 0

// Controlled modification
privateCounter.set((prev) => prev + 1);
console.log(privateCounter.get()); // 1

// Reset to initial value
privateCounter.reset();
console.log(privateCounter.get()); // 0
```

### 2. createCounter

Creates a counter closure with increment, decrement, and reset functionality. This utility is useful for:

- Managing numeric state with controlled operations
- Implementing counters with atomic operations
- Maintaining an isolated counter state
- Providing a clean API for counter manipulation

Example usage:

```tsx
const { createCounter } = useClosure();

const counter = createCounter(10);

console.log(counter.increment()); // 11
console.log(counter.increment()); // 12
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 11
console.log(counter.getValue()); // 11
counter.reset(); // back to 10
console.log(counter.getValue()); // 10
```

### 3. createMemoizer

Creates a memoization closure that caches function results. This is useful for:

- Optimizing expensive calculations by storing previous results
- Avoiding redundant computations for the same inputs
- Improving performance in computation-heavy applications
- Caching API responses to reduce network requests
- Implementing efficient recursive algorithms

The memoizer maintains a private cache and returns cached results when available, only computing new values when needed.

Example use cases:

- Caching expensive mathematical computations
- Storing results of complex data transformations
- Optimizing recursive functions like Fibonacci
- Caching API responses in data-fetching scenarios
- Memoizing expensive component render calculations

```tsx
const { createMemoizer } = useClosure();

const expensiveFunction = (n: number) => {
  console.log("Computing...");
  return n * n;
};

const memoized = createMemoizer(expensiveFunction);

console.log(memoized(5)); // Computing... 25
console.log(memoized(5)); // 25 (cached, no "Computing...")
console.log(memoized(3)); // Computing... 9
```

### 4. createModule

Implements the module pattern with private state and public methods. This pattern is beneficial for:

- **Encapsulation**: Keep internal state private and only expose necessary methods
- **Organization**: Group related functionality and data together
- **Maintainability**: Changes to internal implementation don't affect external code
- **Interface Control**: Provide a clean, well-defined API for interacting with the module
- **State Protection**: Prevent direct manipulation of internal state from outside
- **Testing**: Easier to test as the public interface is clearly defined
- **Dependency Management**: Better control over dependencies and their interactions

```tsx
const { createModule } = useClosure();

const userModule = createModule(
  { name: "", age: 0 },
  {
    setName: (state, name: string) => {
      state.name = name;
      return `Name set to ${name}`;
    },
    setAge: (state, age: number) => {
      if (age >= 0) {
        state.age = age;
        return `Age set to ${age}`;
      }
      return "Invalid age";
    },
    getInfo: (state) => `${state.name}, ${state.age} years old`,
  }
);

userModule.setName("John");
userModule.setAge(30);
console.log(userModule.getInfo()); // "John, 30 years old"
```

### 5. createEventEmitter

Creates an event emitter using closure-based private state for event handling. This pattern is excellent for:

- **Event Management**: Efficiently handle event subscriptions and emissions
- **Memory Management**: Automatically clean up listeners when they're no longer needed
- **Encapsulation**: Keep event listeners private and protected from external manipulation
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple event types and handlers
- **Scalability**: Handle growing numbers of events and subscribers efficiently
- **Debugging**: Easier to track event flow and diagnose issues
- **Testing**: Simulate and verify event-driven behaviors in isolation

```tsx
const { createEventEmitter } = useClosure();

const emitter = createEventEmitter();

// Subscribe to events
const unsubscribe = emitter.on("test", (data) => {
  console.log("Received:", data);
});

// Emit events
emitter.emit("test", "Hello World!"); // Received: Hello World!

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();

// No longer receives events
emitter.emit("test", "Hello again!"); // Nothing happens
```

### 6. createSecureState

Creates secure state with validation using closures. This pattern is excellent for:

- **Data Validation**: Enforce rules and constraints on state updates
- **Type Safety**: Ensure state only contains valid values
- **Access Control**: Restrict how state can be modified
- **Error Prevention**: Catch invalid updates before they occur
- **Debugging**: Easier to track state changes and identify issues
- **Maintainability**: Centralize validation logic in one place
- **Security**: Prevent unauthorized or invalid state modifications

Example usage:

```tsx
const { createSecureState } = useClosure();

const secureAge = createSecureState(
  25,
  (age: number) => age >= 0 && age <= 150
);

console.log(secureAge.read()); // 25
console.log(secureAge.write(30)); // true
console.log(secureAge.read()); // 30
console.log(secureAge.write(-5)); // false (invalid)
console.log(secureAge.read()); // 30 (unchanged from invalid write)
```

### 7. demonstrateScope

Demonstrates how closures capture and maintain access to outer scope variables. This pattern is useful for:

- **Learning**: Understanding how closure scope and variable access works
- **Debugging**: Visualizing variable capture in nested functions
- **Teaching**: Demonstrating scope chain and variable lifetime
- **Testing**: Verifying proper variable access across scopes
- **Development**: Building functions that need access to outer variables
- **Maintenance**: Ensuring proper scope isolation and variable access
- **Documentation**: Showing real examples of closure behavior

Example usage:

```tsx
const { demonstrateScope } = useClosure();

const scope = demonstrateScope();
console.log(scope.outerVar); // "I'm in the outer scope"

const innerFunction = scope.createInner("inner variable");
console.log(innerFunction());
// "I'm in the outer scope and inner variable (from inner scope)"
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Private State in a React Component

This example demonstrates using `createPrivateState` to manage form data with controlled access. The component:

1. Creates a private state object containing name and email fields
2. Provides controlled input handlers that safely update the private state
3. Includes a reset function to clear the form
4. Displays the current values while maintaining data privacy

The key benefits of this approach are:

- The state can only be accessed through the provided getter/setter methods
- Updates are handled in a controlled manner
- The reset functionality easily restores initial values
- The state remains encapsulated within the component

Here's the implementation:

```tsx
function PrivateStateComponent() {
  const { createPrivateState } = useClosure();

  // Create private state that can only be accessed through methods
  const privateUser = createPrivateState({ name: "", email: "" });

  const handleNameChange = (e) => {
    privateUser.set((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      name: e.target.value,
    }));
  };

  const handleEmailChange = (e) => {
    privateUser.set((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      email: e.target.value,
    }));
  };

  const handleReset = () => {
    privateUser.reset(); // Reset to initial empty values
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <label>Name:</label>
        <input value={privateUser.get().name} onChange={handleNameChange} />
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Email:</label>
        <input value={privateUser.get().email} onChange={handleEmailChange} />
      </div>

      <div>
        <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Current Values:</h3>
        <p>Name: {privateUser.get().name}</p>
        <p>Email: {privateUser.get().email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Memoized API Data Fetching

This example demonstrates using `createMemoizer` to optimize API data fetching by caching responses. Here's what's happening in the code:

1. The component uses `createMemoizer` to create a memoized version of the fetch function
2. The memoized function is created inside `useMemo` to ensure it persists across renders
3. When fetching data for a user ID:
   - If it's the first request for that ID, it makes an API call
   - If the same ID is requested again, it returns the cached result without making another API call
4. The component includes:
   - An input field for the user ID
   - A fetch button that triggers the request
   - Loading state handling
   - Display of the fetched results
   - A helpful message explaining the caching behavior

Key benefits of this approach:

- Prevents redundant API calls for previously fetched IDs
- Improves performance and reduces server load
- Maintains a clean cache of responses
- Provides immediate responses for cached data

The console.log message ("Fetching data for user...") helps demonstrate when actual API calls are made versus when cached data is returned.

```tsx
function MemoizedApiComponent() {
  const { createMemoizer } = useClosure();
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState("");

  // Create a memoized fetch function
  const memoizedFetch = useMemo(() => {
    return createMemoizer(async (id) => {
      console.log(`Fetching data for user ${id}...`);
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`
      );
      return await response.json();
    });
  }, []);

  const handleFetch = async () => {
    if (!userId) return;

    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const data = await memoizedFetch(userId);
      setResult(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <label>User ID:</label>
        <input value={userId} onChange={(e) => setUserId(e.target.value)} />
        <button onClick={handleFetch} disabled={loading}>
          {loading ? "Loading..." : "Fetch"}
        </button>
      </div>

      {result && (
        <div>
          <h3>User Data:</h3>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )}

      <p>
        <small>
          Try fetching the same ID multiple times - you'll see the fetch message
          only appears once for each unique ID.
        </small>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Event System with Closures

This example demonstrates how to use `createEventEmitter` to implement a pub/sub (publish/subscribe) pattern in a React component. Here's what's happening:

1. **Component Setup**

- Creates a chat-like interface with multiple channels (general, announcements, support)
- Uses useState to manage messages and input state
- Uses useRef to persist the event emitter instance

2. **Event Emitter Creation**

- Creates an event emitter once using useRef to avoid recreating on re-renders
- Sets up listeners for three different channels:
  - general: prefixes messages with [General]
  - announcements: prefixes messages with [Announcement]
  - support: prefixes messages with [Support]

3. **User Interface**

- Provides a channel selector dropdown
- Has an input field for message text
- Includes a send button to emit messages
- Displays all messages in a list with their channel prefix

4. **Message Handling**

- When a message is sent, it's emitted to the selected channel
- The appropriate listener catches the message and adds it to the messages state
- Messages are displayed in chronological order with their channel prefix

This pattern is useful for:

- Implementing chat systems
- Creating notification systems
- Building real-time updates
- Managing communication between different parts of an application
- Handling event-driven interactions

The event emitter ensures that messages are properly routed to their intended channels while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

```tsx
function EventSystemComponent() {
  const { createEventEmitter } = useClosure();
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");
  const [channel, setChannel] = useState("general");

  // Create an event emitter (only once with useRef)
  const emitterRef = useRef(null);
  if (emitterRef.current === null) {
    emitterRef.current = createEventEmitter();

    // Set up listeners for different channels
    emitterRef.current.on("general", (msg) => {
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, `[General] ${msg}`]);
    });

    emitterRef.current.on("announcements", (msg) => {
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, `[Announcement] ${msg}`]);
    });

    emitterRef.current.on("support", (msg) => {
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, `[Support] ${msg}`]);
    });
  }

  const handleSend = () => {
    if (!message) return;

    // Emit the message to the selected channel
    emitterRef.current.emit(channel, message);
    setMessage("");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <select value={channel} onChange={(e) => setChannel(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="general">General</option>
          <option value="announcements">Announcements</option>
          <option value="support">Support</option>
        </select>

        <input
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type a message..."
        />

        <button onClick={handleSend}>Send</button>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Messages:</h3>
        <ul>
          {messages.map((msg, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{msg}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Important Notes

1. Closures maintain their own independent scope and state, making them ideal for encapsulation.
2. Each utility function creates a new closure with its own isolated environment.
3. The module pattern (`createModule`) is particularly useful for organizing related functionality.
4. Memoization (`createMemoizer`) can significantly improve performance for expensive calculations.
5. Event emitters (`createEventEmitter`) provide a clean way to implement pub/sub patterns.
6. Secure state (`createSecureState`) allows for controlled access with validation.
7. All created closures persist between renders but are recreated if the component unmounts and remounts.

## Performance Considerations

- Closures maintain references to their outer scope, which can prevent garbage collection if not managed properly.
- For performance-critical code, be mindful of creating too many closures unnecessarily.
- The memoization utility is particularly useful for expensive operations but consumes memory to store cached results.
- Consider using `useCallback` and `useMemo` when working with closures in React components to prevent unnecessary recreations.

## Conclusion

The [useClosure](/docs/use-closure) hook provides a powerful set of utilities for working with JavaScript closures in React applications. By leveraging the encapsulation and state persistence capabilities of closures, you can create more maintainable, efficient, and secure code. Whether you need private state management, memoization, event handling, or secure data access, the useClosure hook offers elegant solutions through its various utility functions.

Happy coding!
