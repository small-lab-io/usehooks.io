Custom hooks are one of React's most powerful features, but managing them across projects can be challenging. In this hands-on tutorial, we'll explore how [usehooks-cli](/docs/usehooks-cli) can transform your development workflow by making it effortless to discover, add, and maintain React hooks in your projects.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:

- Set up usehooks-cli in your React project
- Find and add the perfect hooks for your needs
- Update and maintain hooks across your codebase
- Integrate hooks with your components
- Manage hook dependencies efficiently

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- A React project (Next.js, Vite, Create React App, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with React hooks

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by initializing usehooks-cli in your React project. There's no need to install anything globallyâ€”we'll use npx to run the CLI directly:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest init
```

This command will:

1. Detect your project structure (Next.js, Vite, CRA, etc.)
2. Suggest optimal locations for your hooks directory
3. Create a configuration file (`usehooks.json`) with your preferences

You'll be prompted to answer a few questions about your project setup:

The CLI is smart enough to detect your project structure and suggest sensible defaults, but you can customize these settings as needed.

## Step 2: Discovering Available Hooks

Before adding hooks to your project, let's explore what's available. usehooks-cli provides several ways to discover hooks:

### Browsing All Hooks

To see a complete list of available hooks organized by category:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest list
```

You'll see output similar to this:

### Searching for Specific Hooks

If you have a specific need in mind, you can search for relevant hooks:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest search "form"
```

This will find all hooks related to form handling, showing matches in names, descriptions, and categories.

## Step 3: Adding Your First Hook

Let's add a hook to your project. For this tutorial, we'll use the popular `use-local-storage` hook, which provides a `useState`-like API that persists data in localStorage:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest add use-local-storage
```

The CLI will:

1. Download the hook from the registry
2. Add it to your hooks directory
3. Install any required dependencies
4. Provide confirmation when complete

You should see output like this:

## Step 4: Using the Hook in Your Component

Now that you've added the hook, let's use it in a component. Create or modify a component file:

```tsx
import { useLocalStorage } from "../hooks/useLocalStorage";

function UserPreferences() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage<"light" | "dark">("theme", "light");
  const [fontSize, setFontSize] = useLocalStorage<number>("fontSize", 16);

  return (
    <div className={`theme-${theme}`}>
      <h2>User Preferences</h2>

      <div>
        <label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={theme === "dark"}
            onChange={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
          />
          Dark Mode
        </label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Font Size: {fontSize}px</label>
        <input
          type="range"
          min="12"
          max="24"
          value={fontSize}
          onChange={(e) => setFontSize(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component uses the `useLocalStorage` hook to persist user preferences across page refreshes and browser sessions.

## Step 5: Getting Detailed Information About a Hook

To learn more about how a hook works and see examples of its usage:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest info use-local-storage
```

This will display comprehensive information about the hook:

## Step 6: Adding Multiple Hooks at Once

As your project grows, you might need multiple hooks. You can add several hooks in one command:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest add use-counter use-debounce use-media-query
```

Alternatively, you can use interactive selection mode by running the command without arguments:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest add
```

This will present a checklist of all available hooks, allowing you to select multiple hooks to add at once.

## Step 7: Keeping Your Hooks Up-to-Date

As the usehooks.io library evolves with bug fixes and improvements, you'll want to keep your hooks updated. To check for and apply updates:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest update --all
```

The CLI will:

1. Compare your installed hooks with the latest versions
2. Create backups of your current hooks
3. Apply updates where available
4. Install any new dependencies

You'll see a summary of what's being updated:

## Step 8: Removing Hooks You No Longer Need

If you decide you no longer need a hook, you can remove it cleanly:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest remove use-counter --clean-deps
```

The `--clean-deps` flag will also remove any dependencies that were installed specifically for this hook and aren't used elsewhere in your project.

## Real-World Project Example: Building a Task Manager

Let's put everything together by building a simple task manager application that uses multiple hooks:

1. First, add the hooks we'll need:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest add use-local-storage use-boolean use-debounce
```

2. Create a TaskManager component:

```tsx
import { useLocalStorage } from "../hooks/useLocalStorage";
import { useBoolean } from "../hooks/useBoolean";
import { useDebounce } from "../hooks/useDebounce";
import { useState } from "react";

interface Task {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

function TaskManager() {
  // Persist tasks in localStorage
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useLocalStorage<Task[]>("tasks", []);

  // UI state
  const [newTaskText, setNewTaskText] = useState("");
  const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");
  const [showCompleted, toggleShowCompleted] = useBoolean(true);

  // Debounce search to improve performance
  const debouncedSearchText = useDebounce(searchText, 300);

  // Filter tasks based on search and completion status
  const filteredTasks = tasks.filter((task) => {
    const matchesSearch = task.text
      .toLowerCase()
      .includes(debouncedSearchText.toLowerCase());
    const matchesCompletion = showCompleted || !task.completed;
    return matchesSearch && matchesCompletion;
  });

  // Add a new task
  const addTask = () => {
    if (newTaskText.trim() === "") return;

    setTasks([
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: Date.now().toString(),
        text: newTaskText,
        completed: false,
      },
    ]);

    setNewTaskText("");
  };

  // Toggle task completion
  const toggleTask = (id: string) => {
    setTasks(
      tasks.map((task) =>
        task.id === id ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
      )
    );
  };

  // Remove a task
  const removeTask = (id: string) => {
    setTasks(tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id));
  };

  return (
    <div className="task-manager">
      <h1>Task Manager</h1>

      {/* Add new task */}
      <div className="add-task">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={newTaskText}
          onChange={(e) => setNewTaskText(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Add a new task..."
        />
        <button onClick={addTask}>Add</button>
      </div>

      {/* Search and filter */}
      <div className="task-filters">
        <input
          type="text"
          value={searchText}
          onChange={(e) => setSearchText(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Search tasks..."
        />
        <label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            checked={showCompleted}
            onChange={() => toggleShowCompleted()}
          />
          Show completed tasks
        </label>
      </div>

      {/* Task list */}
      <ul className="task-list">
        {filteredTasks.length === 0 ? (
          <li className="empty-state">No tasks found</li>
        ) : (
          filteredTasks.map((task) => (
            <li key={task.id} className={task.completed ? "completed" : ""}>
              <input
                type="checkbox"
                checked={task.completed}
                onChange={() => toggleTask(task.id)}
              />
              <span>{task.text}</span>
              <button onClick={() => removeTask(task.id)}>Delete</button>
            </li>
          ))
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example demonstrates how multiple hooks can work together to create a feature-rich application with persistent storage, debounced search, and toggle functionality.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Hook Not Found

If you encounter a "Hook not found" error, try searching for similar hooks:

```bash
npx usehooks-cli@latest search "keyword"
```

### Dependency Conflicts

If you experience dependency conflicts, you can manually resolve them by editing your package.json or use the `--clean-deps` flag when removing hooks.

### TypeScript Errors

Make sure your TypeScript configuration is compatible with the hooks. Most hooks require TypeScript 4.0 or higher and the appropriate DOM lib settings.
